# Submission Manager
A web app for managing document submissions to a magazine, press, publisher, etc. It was created to meet the project requirements for the Code Louisville Software Development 2 course.

This program can take document submissions from submitters, and allow them to check the status of their submissions. Administrators can then review submissions, and accept or reject them.
